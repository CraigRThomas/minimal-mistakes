<strong>Unity/C#</strong><br>
Top-down 3D co-op arena wave-clearing game. 2 players must work together to clear the waves of enemies that spawn. Players can move freely, but the only way to attack is to charge a dash attack that always aims you towards your partner. While you are charging your attack, your partner's movement speed is decreased, meaning communication is vital to success. Made for TOJAM9 with 4 other team members (2 other programmers and 2 artists). <br>
